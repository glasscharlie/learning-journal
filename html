### Process and Design
 
 #### things to consider
 - Every website should be designed for the target audience

 - Why are people coming to your website?

 - What are your visitors trying to achieve?

 - What information your visitors need

 - How often people will visit your sight

 #### Process

 - *Site maps* - create a diagram of the pages that will be used

 - *Card sorting* - helps you decide what information should go on which page

 - *Wireframes* - simple sketch of the key information on each page, shows hierarchy of information

 #### Getting your message across
- *Content* - designer needs to organize and priortize information to help user find what they are looking for

- Prioritizing - designers create a visual hierarchy to help users focus on key messages

- Organization - Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks to make the page look simpler. Similarity can be used to make users assosciate that style with a particular type of content.

<html>
       <head>

	      (meta info and dependecies)
       </head>

- Articles

- Asides
