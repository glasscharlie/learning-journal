#Git Tutorial

Known as a stupid content tracker, used to share code and colabboration Distributed Version Control Systems (dvcs) to the masses

### What is GitHub?
- A version control sytem

- Lets multiple developers work on the same code

- Has a history of changes to files

- Ability to view, apply, and remove changes

- Keeps all project files in one directory

### Snapshots in time
- Commits represent each successive version of a file or files

- Commits are the git Equivelent of 'save as'

- Each commit has a label that points to it

- HEAD = the label meaning "you are here"

- Usually you give a snapshot a label called a message

- Three stages (Commit, Modify, Staged)

### Git Commands

- git config --list

- git help command

- git command --help

- man git -command

- git remote

- git remote -v

### ACP (add, commit, push)

- Clone your repo --> git clone github.url.git
- Add stuff (files/code)
- Save your added stuff ---> git add filename
- Lock our changes ---> git commit -m "some message"      
- git commit - a = save all changes
- Get changes to github ---> get push origin master
