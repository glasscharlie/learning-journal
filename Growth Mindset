# Growth Mindset




### What is growth mindset?
Growth mindset is knowing that people are always capable of further learning, no matter what they have learned in the past or how fast we are able to understand things.

### How to stay in a growth mindset
- When you make a mistake, understand that it is a learning opertunity, not a failure

- Put everything into a positive connotation
    >~~Im bad at coding~~ I'm still learning how to code
    
    >~~I don't care about this~~ This is not a priority for me right now
    
    >~~I would never do that~~ It's hard for me to imagine doing that at the moment
    
- Try different learning tactics, everybody learns differently and at their own pace
